# 🎯 AuctionApp

AuctionApp is a Blazor web application that implements an auction system. Users can add bidders, import bidders from files, and determine the winner of the auction based on the set reserve price. The application is built with a modular project structure, containing separate layers for core logic, UI, and testing.

## 🔍 Modules

### 🚀 1. AuctionApp.Core
- Contains the core business logic, models, and services.
- **Key Components:**
  - **Models:**
    - `Bid`: Represents an individual bid with a specific amount.
    - `Bidder`: Represents a participant in the auction with a name and a list of bids.
    - `Result`: Represents the auction result with the winner's name and the price.
  - **Services:**
    - `AuctionService`: Implements auction logic to determine winners.
    - Logic includes filtering bids by reserve price and picking the highest valid bid.
  - **Interfaces:**
    - `IAuctionService`: Interface for the auction service.

### 💻 2. AuctionApp.UI
- Blazor-based user interface for interacting with the auction system.
- **Key Pages:**
  - `Index.razor`: Homepage of the application.
  - `AuctionResults.razor`: Displays the calculated auction results.
- **Key Components:**
  - ➕ **AddBidderForm.razor**: Form for adding new bidders with their bids.
  - 📤 **FileImporter.razor**: Allows importing bidders from JSON/CSV files.
  - 🔄 **AuctionActions.razor**: Provides controls to set a reserve price and start the auction.
  - 👥 **BidderList.razor**: Displays the list of all bidders and their bids.
- Built-in navigation and a clean design for displaying auction functionalities.

### 🧪 3. AuctionApp.Tests
- Contains unit tests to verify the correctness of the auction logic.
- **Key Test Class:**
  - `AuctionServiceTests`: Validates `AuctionService` for various edge cases.
- **Key Test Scenarios:**
  - ❌ No valid bids => "No Winner".
  - ✅ A single valid bid => Winner is the only bidder.
  - 🔢 Multiple valid bids => Winner is the bidder with the highest bid.
  - 🔄 Handle ties in bids => Winner is the first valid bidder in case of ties.

## 🎯 Example Workflow

1. ➕ Add bidders manually or import them:
   - Use the **Add Bidders Form** to add bidders with their bids.
   - 📤 Import bidders using a JSON or CSV file upload.
     - JSON format:
       ```json
       [
           { "Name": "A", "Bids": [110, 130] },
           { "Name": "B", "Bids": [] },
           { "Name": "C", "Bids": [125] }
       ]
       ```
     - CSV format example:
       ```
       A, 110, 130
       B
       C, 125
       ```
2. Set the reserve price for the auction.
3. 🏁 Click the **Start Auction** button to determine the winner.
4. 🏆 View the results: Winner's name and the final price.

## ✅ Testing

Run the test suite to verify the functionality of the `AuctionService`:

1. Navigate to the test project:
   ```bash
   cd AuctionApp.Tests
   ```
2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```
3. 🚦 The tests will validate edge cases such as:
   - ❌ No valid bids.
   - ✅ Multiple valid bids.
   - 🔄 Tie handling.
